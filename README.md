# Machine_learning_models_plants_dataset_capstone
 The dataset is first part contains Exploratory Data Analysis using seaborn, then preprocessing and then moves to the building of the models
 After implementing many models, the top 3 models with the best performance parameters are selected- KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest
 Performance of all the three are compared with all the performance metrics after hyperparameter tuning.
 The dataset is called capstone_test.csv and capstone_train accordingly on kaggle. The program uses locally stored files to run the models 
 So please download these datasets 
 change the upload part of the code to upload it from other sources accordingly.
 The dataset Training contains 464810 rows and 13 columns
 The dataset Testing contains 116204 rows and 13 columns
